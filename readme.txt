Widget that displays the current post author's Gravatar photo, name, website, and biography. 

== Description ==

I created this plugin to address a problem brought up in this forum thread:
`http://wordpress.org/support/topic/dynamic-image-in-sidebar`

This plugin creates a simple widget you can drop into any sidebar. On single posts, it will display 
the post author's Gravatar photo, as well as their name, website, and biography specified on their profile.

On other pages, it does nothing and is invisible to visitors. Options include changing the widget title and the photo size.

You can style the widget using your own CSS if you like. The CSS ID for the widget is `#odai-author-widget`
